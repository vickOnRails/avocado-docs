# Accordion

> This demo is not perfect because theming is off and still a work in progress

The `Accordion` component renders a group of block headers that control the visibility of certain `AccordionPanel`s.

## Usage

The easiest way to get started is by wrapping the `Accordion` around the `AccordionPanel` components like so...

```jsx live noInline
import { Accordion, AccordionPanel } from '@avocado-ui/react'
render(
  <Accordion>
    <AccordionPanel header='React'>
      React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
      interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community
      of individual developers and companies.
    </AccordionPanel>
    <AccordionPanel header='CSS'>
      Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
      presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
    </AccordionPanel>
    <AccordionPanel header='JavaScript'>
      JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
      conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    </AccordionPanel>
  </Accordion>
)
```

This automatically sets up a clickable `button` element underneath, alongside a panel for showing content.

## Sizes

You can control how large/small the `Accordion` can be with the `size` prop either set to `sm`, `md` or `lg`. The `Accordion` component is built to be aware of the `size` prop, so it reduces the `font-size`, `padding` and `border`.

Below is an example of 2 `Accordion` components with `size` of `sm` and `lg` respectively...

```jsx live noInline
import { Accordion, AccordionPanel } from '@avocado-ui/react'
render(
  <>
    <Accordion size='sm'>
      <AccordionPanel header='React'>
        React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a
        community of individual developers and companies.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='CSS'>
        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
        presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='JavaScript'>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
      </AccordionPanel>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion size='lg'>
      <AccordionPanel header='React'>
        React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a
        community of individual developers and companies.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='CSS'>
        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
        presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='JavaScript'>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
      </AccordionPanel>
    </Accordion>
  </>
)
```

## width

You can control the width of the `Accordion` component with the `width` prop. This limits the horizontal size of the component.

> The `width` prop does not currently parse the input, so you have to pass in the full width alongside the units.

```jsx live noInline
import { Accordion, AccordionPanel } from '@avocado-ui/react'
render(
  <>
    <Accordion width='15em'>
      <AccordionPanel header='React'>
        React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a
        community of individual developers and companies.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='CSS'>
        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
        presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='JavaScript'>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
      </AccordionPanel>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion fullWidth>
      <AccordionPanel header='React'>
        React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a
        community of individual developers and companies.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='CSS'>
        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
        presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='JavaScript'>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
      </AccordionPanel>
    </Accordion>
  </>
)
```

## Icon

The `Accordion` component comes default with a downward facing arrow on the right. You can control the position and visibility of the icon by using the `iconPosition` and `showIcon` props respectively.

Here's an example of hiding the icon with the `showIcon` prop...

```jsx live noInline
import { Accordion, AccordionPanel } from '@avocado-ui/react'
render(
  <>
    <Accordion showIcon={false}>
      <AccordionPanel header='React'>
        React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a
        community of individual developers and companies.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='CSS'>
        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
        presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      </AccordionPanel>
    </Accordion>
  </>
)
```

Here's another example of the icon positioned on the left with `iconPosition` set to `left`.

```jsx live noInline
import { Accordion, AccordionPanel } from '@avocado-ui/react'
render(
  <>
    <Accordion iconPosition='left'>
      <AccordionPanel header='React'>
        React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a
        community of individual developers and companies.
      </AccordionPanel>
      <AccordionPanel header='CSS'>
        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
        presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      </AccordionPanel>
    </Accordion>
  </>
)
```
