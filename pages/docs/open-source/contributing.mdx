# Contributing

> It's great if you want to contribute. The idea is pretty young and I'm learning on the job, but I'm also open to contributions. Think bug fixes, feature and pull requests.

## How to contribute

- Fork the [`avocado-ui`](github.com/vickOnRails/avocado-ui) repository to you account
- Clone your fork to your local machine
- Create a branch with your name
- Make your changes, test and push to your branch
- Go to GitHub.com and send your pull request
