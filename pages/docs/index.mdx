# Introduction

> avocado-ui is an experimental design system for building highly themeable, accessible and modern interfaces in React.

## Why 🥑 avocado-ui

There are lots of wondeful design systems out there, so why make another?

I'm building `avocado-ui` to increase my knowledge of design systems. This project is a cure for my interest and intrigue in design systems. The argument is that building a design system from scratch will help me learn more about design systems. I don't expect people to use it, but you can learn a thing or two by diving into the [source code](https://github.com/vickOnRails/avocado-ui).

### Features

- **♿ Accessible**: Accessibility is not an after thought in `avocado`. All components have accessible names and are called out correctly by screen readers. I ensure colors are accessibile, focus indicators are present on all components and they are in the right tab order.
- **💅🏼 Themeable**: `avocado` is highly themeable and the entire look can be controlled by tokens. I'm currently researching about `styled-system` and the goal is to ensure `avocado` follows the spec.
- **🌃 Dark Mode**: Good design systems handle darkmode excellently. I'm also researching & learning the best way to implement dark mode in avocado.
- **😎 Modern**: Modern design systems are a combination of tooling, look and feel of the interface. You have to really work hard to make avocado ugly 😋.

I'll be sharing my progress with `avocado` on twitter. Please [follow me](https://twitter.com/home) to learn more.
